deps

Ubuntu/Debian
```
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

Windows

```
If you're running on Windows you'll need a gcc compiler that the go tool can use and have gcc.exe in your PATH environmental variable. We recommend Mingw since it has been tested. You'll also need git installed, we recommend getting it from The official Git site
